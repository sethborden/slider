## Slider

Single page app that let's you navigate through image links from reddit and imgur.

Pick out which subreddits you're interested in, pick a timeframe and click fetch.

Still a work in progress, but the basic functionality is all there.

### Usage:

Once you have the subreddits you want to fetch from click fetch, this takes awhile if you're getting images from a subreddit with lots of imgur albums as the number of AJAX calls goes up.  Once everything is displayed, click on an image to go into viewing mode. Left and right arrows let you navigate through images, up and down allow you to start going through albums.

In image viewing mode:

- S - Starts or stops the slideshow
- Right - Next image
- Left - Previous image
- Up - Start viewing the album
- Down - Stop viewing the album
- Esc - Exit the viewing window (This can also be done by clicking outside the viewing area.)
